# Dual Quaternion Quintic Blends (DQQB) Algorithm

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Dual Quaternion Quintic Blends (DQQB) algorithm, as detailed in our paper: "Dual Quaternion Quintic Blends: $\mathcal{C}^2$-Continuous, Time-Optimized Interpolation of Unit Dual Quaternions". The DQQB algorithm is a novel method for interpolating unit dual quaternions, offering $\mathcal{C}^2$-continuous trajectories, ideal for robotic applications requiring high precision and smooth motion.

## Features
- Implementation of the DQQB algorithm for trajectory planning.
- Examples demonstrating the use of the algorithm in various scenarios.
- Tools for evaluating and visualizing the trajectories.
- Comprehensive documentation for ease of use and customization.

## Installation
Instructions to set up the environment and install necessary dependencies.
